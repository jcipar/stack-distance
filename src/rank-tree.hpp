/*
  This file contains two classes that implement a treap-based
  RankTree. A RankTree is an unsorted (i.e. not sorted by the values
  of the data) binary tree augmented with parent pointers and
  weights. The weight of a node is the number of nodes rooted at that
  subtree.

  Using this extra data, the tree can be viewed as a vector that
  supports the following operations efficiently:
 
  - Insert(node, i): insert a new node at position i.
  - Get(i): get the node at position i.
  - GetLast(i): get the last node.
  - Remove(i): remove the node at position i.
  - Rank(node): find the position of the node in the tree. 

  Note that Rank() is *not* finding the position of a node in the tree
  with matching data, as in a binary search tree. The node must be a
  pointer to an actual element of the tree (generally one returned by
  Get().

  For purposes of this program only a subset of these operations are
  supported, though the tree could be easily extended to support the
  more general set of operations. These are the supported operations:

  - Insert(node or string): insert at position 0, i.e. Insert(_, i).
  - First(): i.e. Get(0).
  - GetLast()
  - Remove(node)
  - Rank(node)
